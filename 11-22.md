Example: Suppose customers arive at a service center (with infinite counters) according to a poisson process with rate \lambda. Suppose, service times independent, distn t. What is expected no of people who have completed service by time t.

Let N_1(t) be the no of people who have completed their service by time t.

What is the probability that an individual arriving at s < t will finish her service by time t? = G(t-s)

This is the probability that a person who comes at time s is put into type 1.

E[N_1(t)] = \lambda t p

p = 1/t \int_0^t G(t-s) ds

E[N_1(t)] = \lambda \int_0^t G(t-s) ds

# Generalized Poisson Process

Let S be a measurable space. Let S^inf be the collection of all countable sunsets of S.
\Pi a random (countable) subset of S. Take a "test set" A \subset S.

Let N(A) = |A \cap \pi|

* D={(x,y) \in S x S; x=y} is measurable in the product space SxS.

Defn: A poisson process on S is defined as pi st 

1. For A_1 A_2 A_3 ... A_k disjoint, {N(A_i)}_i are independent.
2. N(A) ~ Poi(\mu(A)) for some \mu(A) \ge 0 \forall A

\mu(A) < \infty => N(A) is finite a.s.
\mu(A) = 0 => \pi\intA = \phi w p 1
\mu(A) = \infty => pi \cap A is countably infinite

From definition, \mu(A) = E[N(A)].

Let {A_i} be disjoint subsets of S & A = U A_i

N(A) = \sum_i=1^\inf N(A_i)

E[N(A)] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} E[N(A_i)]

\mu(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_i)

Thus \mu is a measure. This is called the mean measure of the Poisson Process.

THM: A mean measure of a PP is non-atomic, that is \mu({x}) = 0 \forall x \in S.
PRF: Suppose \mu({x}) != 0. Then P(N({x}) \ge 2) > 0, which is a contradiction.
