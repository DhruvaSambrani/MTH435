h_i^j (n) =  P_i(T_j=n) = f_ij^n

To Prove:
pij^n = sum f_ij^m pjj^(n-m)

Proof:
pij^n = P_i(X_n = j) = P(X_n=j | X_0=i)
        = sum_m=1^n P_i (X_n=j, T_j=m)
        = sum_m=1^n P_i (X_n=j| T_j=m)P(T_j = m)
        = sum_m=1^n f_ij^m P(T_j = m)
        = sum_m=1^n f_ij^m p_jj^(n-m) } from SMP

Define N_i = Sum_k=1^infty TT_{X_n = i} = no of visits to state i

Proposition:
P_i(N_j = k) = {
    1 - f_ij for k=0
    f_ij (1-f_jj) f_jj^k-1 for k>0
}
Where f_ij = P_i(T_j < infty).

For k = 0,
P_i(N_j = 0) = P_i(T_j = infty)
            = 1- P_i(T_j < infty)
            = 1 - f_ij

For k>0
Proof by induction:
P_i(N_j = k)    = P_i(T_j^k+1 - T_j^k = infty, T_j < infty)
                = P_i(T_j^k+1 - T_j = infty | T_j^k < infty) P_i(T_j^infty < infty)
                = P_j(T_j = infty) P_i(T_j^k < infty)
                = (1 - f_jj) P_i(T_j^k < infty)
                = (1-f_jj) P_i(N_j >= k)
                = (1 -f_jj) (1 - sum_r=0^k-1 P_i(N_j = r))
                = (1 -f_jj) (1 - [1 - f_ij + sum_r=0^k-1 f_ij (1-fjj) f_jj^{r-1} ]) from induction hypothesis
                = (1 -f_jj) (f_ij - f_ij (f_jj^0 - f_jj^k-1))
                = (1 - f_jj) (f_ij f_jj^k-1)

# Recurrence and Transience of a Markov Chain

i in S is called recurrent if P(X_n = i for infinitely many n) = 1

it is called transient if P(X_n = i for infinitely many n) = 0

Theorem: TFAE
1. i in S is recurrent
2. f_ii = 1
3. P_i(N_i = infinity) = 1
4. E_i[N_i] = infinity
5. sum_n p_ii^(n) = infty

1 <=> 3 by defn
3 ==> 4 is obvious
4 ==> 3 requires the fact that N_i ~ Geom(f_ii) => P_i(N_i = infty) = 1
1 <=> 2 f_ii = P_i(T_i < infty) = 1; so if P(X_n = i) = 1 for some n, it must hit i again in finite time.
4 <=> 5 E_i[sum_n=1^infty I_{X_n = i}] = sum_n P_i(X_n = i) = sum_n p_ii^n

Theorem: TFAE
1. i in S is transient
2. f_ii < 1
3. P_i(N_i < infinity) = 1
4. E_i[N_i] < infinity
5. sum_n p_ii^(n) < infinity
In particular, i transient => p_ii^(n) -> 0

Proposition: If j is transient then p_ij^(n) -> 0 as n -> infty.

Recall 
pij^n   = sum_{m=1}^n f_ij^m pjj^(n-m)
sum_n pij^n = sum_n sum_{m=1}^n f_ij^m pjj^(n-m)
            = sum_m f_ij^(m) sum_{n=m}^infty p_jj^(n-m)
            = (1 - E_j[N_j]) sum_m=1^infty f_ij^(m)
            = (1 - E_j[N_j]) P_i(T_j < infty)
            < infty

=> p_ij^n -> 0 as n -> infty

## Transience is a class property

Let i in S be transient. C be communicating class of i and take j in C.

there exists n,m st pij^(n), pji^(m) > 0

forall r >= 0; p_ii(n+r+m) >= p_ij^n p_jj^r p_ji^m

sum_r^infty p_jj^(r) <= 1/(p_ii^n p_ji^m) sum_r=0^infty p_ii^(n+r+m) < infty because i is transient.

=> p_jj^(r) -> 0 as r -> infty.

Hence, j is also transient.

## Recurrent classes are closed

Let i in C; C not closed.

Then exists j st i -> j; j -/-> i;

Then exists m st p_ij^(m) > 0;

P_i(X_n = i, X_m = j) = P_i(X_n = i | X_m = j) P_i(X_m = j) = 0

P_i(X_n = i for infinitely many n)  = P_i(A_n) 
                                    = P_i({X_m = j} CAP A_n) + P_i({X_m != j} CAP A_n)
                                    = P_i({X_m != j} CAP A_n)
                                    <= P_i(X_m != j) = 1 - P_i(X_m = j) < 1

Therefore i is not recurrent.

## Positive Recurrence and Null Recurrence

i in S, i recurrent, is positive recurrent if E_i[T_i] < infty
i in S, i recurrent, is null recurrent if E_i[T_i] = infty

### Connection with the stationary distribution

Aim: 

1. Irreducability + Recurrence => balance equation is satisfied
2. Irreducability + Positive Recurrence => normalization is satisfied
