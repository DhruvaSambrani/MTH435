P(N(A_i) = n_i, ... | N(A) = n)

case 1: A_i < A \forall i

P(N(A_i)=n_i...k, N(A\ U_iA_i) = n-\sum n_i) / P(N(A) = n)

= PI_i^k \frac{e^{-\mu(A_i)}\mu(A_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!}\frac{e^{-\mu(A')}\mu(A')^{n'}}{n'!} / \frac{e^{-\mu(A)}\mu(A)^{n}}{n!}

# Superposition Theorem

Let \pi_i be a countable collection of independent Poisson processes with means as mu_i. Then 

pi = U pi_i is a Poisson process with mean mu= sum_i^inf mu_i

## Disjointness Lemma

Let pi_i be ind PPs on S with means mu_i, Let A be a measurable subset on S such that mu(A) < inf. Then, 
P(pi_1 \cap pi_2 \cap A = \phi ) = 1

Suppose \sum_i^inf < inf. Let A <= S be measurable. 

=> mu_n(A) < inf forall n

N(A) = sum_i N_i(A)

from the Disjointness lemma, 

    ~ Poi(\sum mu_i)

If for some n mu_n(A) = inf. 
=> N_n(A) = inf => N(A) = inf

If {A_i} are disjoint, then {N(A_i)} are independent because {N_j(A_i)} are independent.


# Restriction 

Let pi be a PP(mu) in S. For any measurable S' in S, pi|_s' can be thought of as a PP on S with mean $\mu'(A) = mu(A \cap S')$

# Mapping Theorem

Let S & T be measurable spaces and f:S --> T be a measurable map.
Let pi be a PP on S. Can we say that f(\pi) is a PP on T?

Is N*(B) = |f(\pi) \cap B| forall B in <= T  measurable a PP?

Let mu* = mu \circ f^{-1} 

But mu* must also be nonatomic. Thus, f should be such that it is injective.

THM: Let pi be a PP on S with a sigma fintie mean measure mu and let f: S --> T be a measureable map such that the induced measure is nonatomic. Then f(\pi) is a PP on T with mean measure mu* = mu \circ f^{-1}

On R^n the interesting PPs are when the mean measure is given by mu(A) = \int_A \lambda(x) dx

\lambda is called the rate/intensity of the PP.

we should recover the homogenous 1D Poisson by setting n=1 and \lambda(x) = \lambda \forall x in R.

homogenous PP(\lambda) on R N(0) = 0

Let {I_i}_{1<=i<=n} be disjoint intervals in R 
- {N(I_i)}_{1<=i<=n} are independent
- P(N(I_i) = k_i) = \frac{e^-\lambda|I_i|(\lambda |I_i|)^k}{k_i!}

Merging: pi_1, pi_2 therefore N_1, N_2 be two ind homogenous PPs with mean mu_1, mu_2. Then pi= pi_1 U pi_2 is also a PP with mu = mu_1 + mu_2

Pf
- N(0) = N_1(0)+N_2(0) = 0
- S_m^1 S_n^2 be mth and nth intervals in process pi_1 & pi_2
P(S^1_m = S^2_n) = 0 for any m,n
=> P(U{S^1_m = S^2_n}) = 0

=> N(I) = N_1(I) + N_2(I) for any interval I \le R_+

For I_1, I_2 disjoint => 
All N_1(I_1), N_1(I_2), N_2(I_1), N_2(I_2) are pairwise independent

=> N(I_1) and N(I_2) are independent

P(\cap_i^m N(I_i)=n_i)
= P(\cap_i^m U_{u_i+l_i = n_i} {N_1(I_i)=k, N_2(I_i)=l_i})
= \pi_i=1^m sum_{k_i + l_i = n_i} e^{-mu_1|I_i|}(mu_1|I_i|)^k_i/k_i! e^{-mu_2|I_i|}(mu_2|I_i|)^l_i/l_i!

On manipulation, 

= \prod_i e^{-(mu_1+mu_2)|I_i|}((\mu_1+\mu_2)|I_i|)^n_i / n_i!
