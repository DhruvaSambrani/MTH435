# Reflection Principle

Fix a state a in Z and place a 2 sided mirror at a.

Observe the SSRW until it hits a.

After that, look at the Reflection of the walk in the mirror.

For n>T_a if x_n is the position of the SSRW, then if x_n' is the corresponding position in the mirror image.

Thus, x_n -a = a - x_n

Define 

tildeS = {
        S_n for n < Ta
        2a-S_n for n >= Ta
}

If {S_n}n>=0 is a SSRW with S_0 = 0, then so is {tildaS_n}n>=0

tildaS_0 = S_0 - 0 by defn

S_N {
    S_n for n<Ta
    a + S_n -a for n>=Ta
}

S_n - a is same as S_Ta+m - a for m>=0

By SMP S_Ta+m -a is a SSRW and so is a - S_{Ta + m}

## Running maximum

M_n = max(S_0, S_1, ..., S_n)

Theorem: P_0(M_n >= a) = P_0(T_a <= n) = 2P0(S_n>=a) - P0(S_n=a) = P0(|S_n| >= a) - 1/2 P0(|Sn| = a)

Proof:

M_n >= a <=> T_a <= n 

Therefore P_0(M_n >= a) = P_0(T_a <= n)

P0(T<=n) = P0(T<=n, Sn<=a) + P0(Ta<=n, Sn > a)

1. {S_n > a} = {Ta <= n, Sn > a}

=> P0(T<=n, Sn>a) = P0(S_n>a)

2. P0(Sn <= a, Ta<=n) = P0(2a-Sn <= a, Ta <= n) ---- Reflection at a
= P0(Sn>=a, T_a<=n)
= P0(Sn >= a)

Now substituting, we prove theorem


# Simple Random Walk

! Note
SRW are not necessarily symmetric.

## Transience

For p != q for p > q, Sn -> infty
For p != q for p < q, Sn -> -infty
For p == q, Sn is null recurrent

P_0(S_n = x) = nC(n+k)/2 p^(n+k)/2 q^(n-k)/2

T_x = inf{n>=0; Sn = x}, S_0 = 0

Tx = T1 + (T2-T1) + (T3-T2) + ... + (T_x - T_x-1)

T_i+1 - T_i are iid (SMP)

T_i+1 - T_i ~ T_1 forall i >= 1

Therefore {Tx} is also an RW or MC.

Theorem:
For SRW,

E_0[s^T_1] = (1- \sqrt{1-4pqs^2})/2qs

Recall:
For a rv X, define the prog gen function of X as Q(s) = E[s^X]

E_0[s^T_1] = E_0[sI_{S1 = 1} + s^(1+T1'+T1'') I_{S1=-1}]

= sP_0(S1=1) + s E_0[s^(T_1'+T_1'')| S1 = -1]P_0(S1=-1)

conditioned on S1 = -1, T1' and T1'' are iid.

and T1' ~ T1 ~ T1'' 

phi(s) = sp + sq phi(s)^2

Solving the quadratic, we conclude.

> Exercise: Find expression for E0[s^Tx]

using this, can we say something about P0(Tx < 0)

First Return time to 0

T0 = inf {n>=1, Sn = 0}

E_0[s^T0] = 1 - \sqrt{1-4pqs^2}
