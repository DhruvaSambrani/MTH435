# Hitting times

For A subset S, define hitting time of A as 

T_A  = inf{n>=0; Xn in A}

Convention inf phi = infinity.

T_A takes values in {0, 1, ...} U {infty}

1. Probability of hitting A P(T_A < inf | X_0 = i) = P_i(T_A < infty)
2. Expected hitting time E[TA | X0 = i] = E_i[TA]
3. Define vector h^a = (h_i^A for i in S), and psi^a = (psi_i^A i in S) by h_i^A = P(T_A < infty), psi_i^A = E[T_A]

Thm: hA is the minimal solution of linear equations given by 

{
    h_1^A = 1                       if i in A
    h_i^A = sum_{j in S} pij h_j^A  if i notin A
}

Proof:
If i in A hiA = 1 is obvious
For i not in A rite TA = 1 + T'A where T'A is the time to hit A after one step

hiA  = P_i(TA < infty)
 = P_i (1+Ta' < infty)
 = sum Pj(1+Ta' < infty | x1 = j) pij 
 = sum Pj(Ta < infty | x0 =j) pij
 = sum hjA pij

Let phiA = (phi_i^A, i in S) be another solution.

Then, phi_i^A = 1 = h_iA for i in A

For i notin A 
phi_i^A = sum pij phi_j^A
        = sum j in A pij + sum j notin A pij phi_j^A
        = sum j in A pij + sum j notin A pij sum_k pjk phi_k^A
        = sum j in A pij + sum j notin A, k in A pij pjk + sum j notin A, k notin A pij pjk phi_k^A

phi_i^A = P(Ta = 1) + P(Ta = 2) + P(Ta = 3) + ... >= P_i(TA <= n).

Taking n -> infty,

phi_i^A >= P_i(TA < infty) = h_iA


Thm: psiA is the minimal solution of linear equations given by 

{
    psi_i^A = 0                             if i in A
    psi_i^A = sum_{j in A^C} pij psi_j^A    if i notin A
}

Prf: 
if i in S, obvious

Ei[TA]  = Ei[1+TA] = sum_j in S E[1+TA' | X_1 = j]pij
        = 1 + E[TA | X_0 =j] pij
        = 1 + sum pij psi_j^A

Let k be another solution.
on i in A, this is obvious

for i not in A, 
k_i^A = 1+ sum_j not in A pij psi_j^A
      = 1 + sum_j notin A pij (1 + sum_l not in A sum_jl k_l^A)
      = 1 + sum_j notin A pij + sum_j in A^C sum l in A^C pjl k_l^A
      = sum_n P_i(T_A >= n)

> Exercise:
> Show sum_n P_i(T_A >= n) = E_i[T_A]

# Stopping times

{X_n} is a random process which is also a MC.

Given a [filteration](wiki:filteration), 

Tau : Omega --> W

is a stopping time if {Tau=n} is measurable wrt F_n where {F_n} is a filteration on Omega.

If {X_n} is an MC, Tau is st wrt {X_n}, if {Tau = n} only depends on (x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n).

{Tau = n} in F_n

Eg: TA is a ST.
Eg: Exit time of A. L_A = sup{n >= 0; X_n in A}; This is not a stopping time.

F_T = {A | A CAP {T = n} in F_n}
ie A CAP {T = n} only depends on (X_0, ... X_n)

To Show: For any A in sigma(X_0, ..., X_m)
P(X_m+1=i_m+1 CAP A | X_m = i) = p_ii_m+1 p_{i_{m+1}i_{m+2}} ... P(A | X_m=i).

Take A = (X_0=i_0, X_1=i_1 ... X_m = i)

Then, 
P(X_m+1=i_m+1,... CAP A | X_m = i) = (lambda_i_0 p_{i_0i_1} ... )/P(X_m = i) = p_ii_m+1 p_{i_{m+1}i_{m+2}} ... P(A | X_m=i)

# Strong Markov Property

Let {X_n} be an MC(lambda, P). Tau is a ST with {X_n}. Suppose tau < infty then conditioned on {Tau = n}, (X_tau+1, X_tau+2, ...) is MC(delta_n, P) and independent of PAST.

## Proof of SMP

Enough to show that For A in F_tau, 

P(X_{tau+1}= i_1, ..., CAP A | X_tau = i, tau < infty) = p_ii_1 p_i1i2 ... P(A|X_tau = i, Tau < infty)

p(x_tau+1 = i_1... cap a, x_tau=i, tau=n)   = P(X_n+1 = i_1... CAP A, X_n=i, tau=n)
                                            = P(X_n+1 = i_1... | A, X_n=i, tau=n) P(A, X_n = i, tau=n)
                                            = P(X_n+1 = i_1... | X_n=i) P(A, X_n = i, tau=n) } Because A in F_tau 
                                            = p_ii1 pi1i2 ... P(A, X_n = i, tau=A)

                                            
P(X_{tau+1}= i_1, ..., CAP A | X_tau = i, tau < infty)  = Sum_n P(X_{tau+1}= i_1, ..., CAP A | X_tau = i, tau = n)
                                                        = p_ii1 pi1i2 ... Sum_n P(A, X_n = i, tau=A)
Now, sum over n and divide by P(Xi= i, Tau < infty).
