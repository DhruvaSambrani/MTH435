Example: Arrival ~ PP(\lambda). Wait till t. What is expected wait time?

E[sum_i^N(t) (t-S_i)] = \sum_n=0^\infty E[\sum_{i=1}^N(t) (t-S_i)| N(t) = n] P(N(t) = n)
    = \sum_n=0^\infty E[\sum_{i=1}^n (t-S_i) | N(t) = n] P(N(t) = n)
    
E[\sum_{i=1}^N(t) (t-S_i)| N(t) = n] = nt - E[\sum_i^n U_i | N(t=n)] = nt/2

E[sum_i^N(t) (t-S_i)] = nt^2/2 \lambda

# Merging and Thinning of Poisson Process

Merging: Let N_1 and N_2 be two ind PP with \lambda_1 and \lambda_2. Then N = N_1 + N_2 is a PP with \lambda_1 + \lambda_2

If X ~ Poi(\mu_i), ind, 

Them what can we say about \sum_i=1^\infty X_i = S

\mu_n = \sum_i=1^n \mu_i

If \mu_n converges to mu as n-> infty then S ~ Poi(\mu)

P(S_n \le r)

{S_n \le r} is a decreasing sequence for fixed r.

P(S \le r) = lim_n\to infty P(S_n \le r) = lim_n\to \infty \sum_k=0^r e^-\mu_n \mu_n^k/k!

Since mu_n \to mu, we take the limit.

Thinning: Given N(t) a PP(\lambda), for every arrival, flip coin, with P(HEADS=p) and label the arrival as type I or type II based on flip. Coins are independent and independent of arrival process. 

Let {Z_n} be ind sequence of Ber(p) rv and ind of the arrival process.

N_1(t) = sum_k^t Z_k \mathbb{I}_{S_k \le t}
N_2(t) = sum_k^t (1-Z_k) \mathbb{I}_{S_k \le t}

P(N_1(t) = n, N_2(t) = m | N(t) = n+m) = P(N_1(t) = n | N(t) = n+m) = (n+m n) p^n (1-p)^m

P(N_1(t) = n, N_2(t) = m) = (n+m n) p^n (1-p)^m e^{\lambda t} (\lambda t)^{n+m}/(n+m)!

= e^{\lambda t p} (\lambda t p)^n/n! e^{\lambda t (1-p)} (\lambda t (1-p))^m/m!

### Examples 

**Example**: Customers arrive in a store at a rate 10/hr

Suppose exactly 5 women (1/2 of all Customers) arived in 10-11.

P(exactly 5 men arrived between 10-11)

Men Arrival ~ PP(5)

P(N_2(t) = 5) = ?

**Example**: Bikes arrive at rate 10. Each bike stops to give a ride w/ p=1/5. Standing in line second, what is probability you wait for 2 hours?
