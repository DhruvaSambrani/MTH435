Given g = (V,E) with |V| = n, the number of spanning trees of G = n^n-2.
- a spanning tree has |v| - 1 edges.
- adding an edge creates an unique cycle

Every subgraph with n-1 edges and no cycles is a spanning tree.

Aim: to sample uniformly from the set of spanning trees of G.

1. Let Xt be a spanning tree S_1. Choose any edge e rom E\E(S_1) uniformly at random.
2. Let C be a unique cycle in X_t U {e}
3. Choose e' from E(C) uniformly.
4. Set X_t+1 = (X_t \ {e}) U {e}

Exercise:
Write the transition matrix of this chain and show that it is irr, aperiodic and symmetric.

Knapsack Problems
m items each with value v_i and weight w_i for 1 < i < n.
Find S = {i,} st argmax_{i,} sum v_i = S and sum w_i < C.

Space of feasible solutions S = {z : <w,z> <= C}

- Start at some z in S
- Choose j in {1,..n} uniformly
- y = (z1, z2, ...(1-z_j)..., zm). If <w, y> <= C
X_{t+1} = y otherwice X_{t+1} = z 

However, the walk is more efficient if we instead sample j,
pi(z) propto e^beta<v,z> for some beta > 0.

## Metropolis algorithm

S is a discrete space. Q a symmetric transition matrix on S an pi, the target distn.

Given X_t, X_t+1 is chosen to follow
1. Choose Y randomly according to Q called the proposal. P(Y=j | X_t = i) = q_ij
2. Define the acceptance probability alpha = min{1, pi_Y/pi_i}
3. Let U ~ uniform(0,1). If U <= alpha then X_t+1 = Y. Otherwise X_t+1 = X_t

P_ij = q_ij * alpha

Prop: If Q is irr, symmetric and pi a prob distn. st pi>0 forall i in S, then the Metropolis chain is also irr, and reversible wrt pi. 
Proof: Q irr => P irr
pi_i p_ij = pi_i q_ij alpha = q_ij min {pi_i, pi_j} = pi_j qij min {1, pi_i/pi_j} = pi_j p_ji
