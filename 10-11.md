# Can a Markov Chain be reversible but not symmetric

Does $pi_i p_{ij} = pi_j p_{ji}$ imply p_ji = p_ij?

No. Consider symmetric 1D chain.

# Markov Chains (Homogeneous)

1. {X_n} is MC(\lambda, P, S) if P(X_0=i) = \lambda_i and P(X_{n+1} | PATH) = P(X_{n+1} | X_{n})
2. if forall n >= 0, P(PATH) = lambda_i0 pi0i1 ... pin-1in
3. Chapman Kolmogorov => p_ij^{n+m} = sum p_ik^n p_kj^m
4. Relations
    a. i --> j if exists PATH(i,j) st P(PATH(i,j)) > 0
    b. i <-> j if i --> j and j --> i. This is an equivalence relation and partitions S into communicating classes
    c. communicating class is closed if sum_{j\inC} p_ij = 1 \forall i \in C
6. Absorbing State - 
    a. i st p_ii = 1
    b. {i} is closed communicating class
7. Irreducible chain - S is a communicating class
8. Inessential state i: If i st i -> j but j -/> i
9. Period of i 
    a. d(i) = gcd{n>=0; pii^n > 0}
    b. is a class property
    c. i is aperiodic then Exists N_0 st p_ii^n > 0 forall n >= N_0
    d. Irreducible and aperiodic => N_0 st p_ij^n > 0 forall n >= N_0
    e. New relation i <-d-> j iff p_ij^(nd) > 0 for some n >= 0. Equivalence.
        1. S decomposed to classes, st chain moves from one C to next.
10. A rv tau : S --> RR, st {tau=n} \in sigma(X_0, ..., X_n) is called a stopping time.
11. SMP - For T, Z_n = X_{T+n} is also a MC.
12. T_i^(r) = inf {n> T_i^(r-1); X_n=i}
13. Chi_i^(r) = {X_n : T_i^(r-1) <= n < T^(r)}
    a. {Chi_i^(r)} are iid from the SMP
14. Hitting Time
    a. h_i^A = P_i(T_A < infty)
    b. h_i^A = 1 for i in A and = sum_j pij h_j^A if i notin A
    c. \psi_i^A = E_i[T_A]
    d. \psi_i^A = 0 for i in A and = 1 + sum_j pij \psi_j^A if i notin A
15. Recurrence and Transience
    a. Both are class properties
16. Stability theorem: irr, + recurrent - P(X_n = i) --n to infty--> pi_i
17. detailed balance <==> KLC
18. Metropolis algorithm
